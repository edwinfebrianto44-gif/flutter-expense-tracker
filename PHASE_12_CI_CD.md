## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Repository Configuration
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flutter-expense-tracker.git
cd flutter-expense-tracker

# Configure GitHub Secrets (see documentation)
# - Backend secrets (Docker, VPS, etc.)
# - Frontend secrets (Android signing, deployment)
# - Security tokens (scanning, notifications)
```

### 2. VPS Setup
```bash
# Run VPS setup script
chmod +x scripts/vps-setup.sh
./scripts/vps-setup.sh

# Configure SSH keys for GitHub Actions
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "github-actions@your-domain.com"
# Add public key to VPS authorized_keys
# Add private key to GitHub Secrets as VPS_SSH_KEY
```

### 3. Android Signing Setup
```bash
# Generate Android signing keystore
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore expense-tracker-release.jks \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
  -alias expense-tracker

# Convert to base64 and add to GitHub Secrets
base64 -i expense-tracker-release.jks | tr -d '\n'
```

### 4. Deployment Verification
```bash
# Test backend deployment
curl https://api.your-domain.com/health

# Test frontend deployment
curl https://your-app.netlify.app

# Download mobile app
# Check GitHub Releases for latest APK
```
