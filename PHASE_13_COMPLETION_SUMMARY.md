- **Request ID Tracking**: Unique UUIDs track requests across the entire application lifecycle
- **Contextual Information**: Rich logging with user info, request details, and performance metrics
- **Security Event Logging**: Authentication attempts, failed logins, and security incidents
- **Business Event Logging**: User registrations, transactions, and business metrics

### üè• Health Monitoring Endpoints
- **`/healthz`**: Basic health check for load balancers
- **`/health`**: Detailed health check with database and system status
- **`/ready`**: Readiness probe for Kubernetes deployments
- **`/live`**: Liveness probe for container orchestration
- **`/metrics`**: Prometheus-format metrics for monitoring

### üìà Metrics Collection
- **Application Metrics**: User counts, transaction statistics, API performance
- **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk usage via psutil integration
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, database query durations
- **Business KPIs**: Registration rates, transaction volumes, user activity

### üñ•Ô∏è VPS Monitoring Solutions
- **Netdata Setup** (`setup-monitoring.sh`): Real-time monitoring with web dashboard
- **Prometheus + Grafana** (`setup-prometheus.sh`): Advanced metrics and visualization
- **Automated Alerts**: System resource and application health monitoring
- **Custom Dashboards**: Tailored monitoring for expense tracker metrics

## üöÄ Key Features Delivered

### 1. Request Tracking
- Every API request gets a unique UUID
- Request ID propagated through all log entries
- Returned in response headers (`X-Request-ID`)
- Full request lifecycle tracking

### 2. Structured Logging Examples
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "logger": "auth",
  "message": "User login successful",
  "request_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "user_id": 123,
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "duration_ms": 45.2
}
```

### 3. Health Check Response
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "checks": {
    "database": {"status": "healthy", "response_time_ms": 12.34},
    "system": {"cpu_percent": 25.5, "memory_percent": 45.2},
    "application": {"total_users": 150, "total_transactions": 2500}
  }
}
```

### 4. Prometheus Metrics
```
expense_tracker_users_total 150
expense_tracker_transactions_total 2500
expense_tracker_system_memory_percent 45.2
expense_tracker_response_time_seconds_bucket{le="1.0"} 892
```
